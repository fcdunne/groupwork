  <p>People fleeing violence and persecution often find it difficult to integrate into a new culture. This is especially true when social interaction is limited due to language barriers. </p>

            <h3> City of Sanctuary</h3>


            <p>City of Sanctuary, a refugee support organisation, hosts a weekly drop-in assisted by a network of  groups for asylum seekers and refugees in Sheffield. Lee Moran from the Conversation Club speaks just a little louder to be heard amidst the bustle. </p>
<p>“We treat everybody – whether they come from the African continent or the Middle East – as one big happy family.</p>
<p>“We don’t know who’s going to come through those doors.  We don’t know if we are going to get 20 people or 200 people. </p>
<p>“That is sometimes not an exaggeration. But it is a challenge, because we treat everybody the same.”</p>


            <h3>The Conversation Club</h3>

            </figure>
<p>The Conversation Club offers help to asylum seekers and refugees with informal English discussion sessions that include some cultural content. </p>
<p>Mr. Moran, who had initially joined for a 6-week trial, has now been with the club for eight years. The reason for this, he says, is the fulfilling nature of the job.</p>
<h3>ASSIST</H3>

            </figure>
<p>Another support group named ASSIST Sheffield works with the Conversation Club to help asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected.</p>
<p>Richard Chessum, the joint chairman of ASSIST Sheffield, said a lot of asylum seekers who have been rejected for residence in the UK are not deported due to various reasons.</p>
<p>“Because the countries they come from won’t have people back, they are here in limbo. And sometimes the Home Office can’t deport them because they can’t get the travel documents.”</p>
<p>He said the only way they can survive is by relying on friends and charity. Under the current rules, asylum seekers do not have the right to work in the UK. </p>

<p>ASSIST was set up in 2003 to support such people who are vulnerable to destitution. They now provide financial aid and accommodation.</p>
<p>However, the financial support is limited to three years and accommodation to one year.</p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s difficult if people are still on our books at the end of that time, because if they don’t have their community to go back to then they are back where they started,” Mr Chessum said. </p>
<p>In such cases, ASSIST tries to help them with their legal process by reviewing Home Office papers, finding out if they can be taken to a solicitor.</p>

          <h3>New Beginnings</h3>

          <p>New Beginnings, another city-based support group, also provides support to people waiting for an answer to their asylum application.</p>
          <p>The group promotes volunteering and community work among refugees and asylum seekers as a way to enhance their skills.</p>
          <p>Moses Lutakome, the volunteer coordinator at New Beginnings, said they first have to make people understand the concept of volunteering.</p>
          <p>“Because from where they are coming from, you work to earn. There’s nothing like working for free. That’s how they look at it.”</p>
          <p>He said most of the people who come to New Beginnings face problems with the language and integrating themselves into the community.</p>
<p>“Things are different, its a culture shock, there are differences, they have just come in. So we are there to make it okay and say: ‘you know what, not a problem. We are here to support you.’</p>
